-both zero and one are crucial (acc. Scott)
-multiplicative inverse also
-second limitation of semi-ring
-first limitation:
  -passing semi-ring into operation rather than attaching to matrix
-problem:
  -A, B structural zeroes are different
-do GraphMat people also use Aydin's document?
-Q: does it make mathematical sense for sA x sB -> sC operation?
-Q: is this a mathematical structure from math literature?
-Q: should semi-rings be attached to the matrix?
-descriptor vs. view debate
-if view is efficiently implementable, it leads to cleaner code
  -but different from C interface
-dataflow diagram for when mask is applied
  -Scott has implemented it both ways:
    1) mask and only perform operations when stored value exists
    2) 
-Q: when you accumulate, when is mask applied? does it clear out value in destination memory?

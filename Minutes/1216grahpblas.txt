-semi-ring not opaque, matrix is opaque
-if no additive inverse, no structural zero
-how to detect structural zero
  -only reason to detect is optimization
  -two optimizations:
    -less storage
    -less computation
-star and plus can create NaN
-how to convert value -> structural zero when +, * to MAX semi-ring
-MATLAB converts two empty sparse matrices ./ into two dense NaN matrices
-standard promotion rules T -> D if T is subset of D
-how about for int32 -> int64
-how about for float -> bool?
               matrix   semi-ring
-Jeremy idea - integer into bool (semi-ring)
  -have user do it themselves
-ask Jeremy for details on hardware team

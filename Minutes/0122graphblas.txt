-what properties do we need the generalized structure (GraphBLAS space) to have?
  -i.e. associativity (john gilbert)
  -0 is additive identity (jeremy kepner)
  -0 is multiplicative annihilator (jeremy kepner)
-chapter 7 and 8 of Jeremy new book
-Q: what are the implications of these generalizations of linear algebra object?
-current specifications:
  -don't use structural zeros
  -so AxB may cause problems if A, B on different spaces
-vector, matrix can use different GraphBLAS spaces (semi-rings)
-C++ implementation may also use descriptors
-collaborative, shared code
  -Apache example of sharing code
-Q: is there particular reason 1 is optional, 0 is mandatory?
  -defined for most people
  -R+ won't cause problems
  -one problem: no 0, we won't be able to materialize the dense matrix
-three different 0s, AxB -> C

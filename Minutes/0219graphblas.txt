-semi-rings:
  -scott claims is composition of 2 monoids (
  -on potentially different sets (not strictly mathematical
  -scott claims there is worth in each monoid having an identity
-descriptors vs. views
  -blas has transpose flag
    -does not change matrix (in memory)
    -matrix is not mutable object that can be changed by descriptor
    -divide-and-conquer read-only data for multithreaded consistency
  -so it needs to be thread-safe
  -there needs to be 1:1 mapping between descriptors and views
    -if they are used
-scott asks:
  -do i have any experience working with masks, descriptors on GPU
-IU/CMU working on testbed for interface research
-multiple vector object?
  -matrices and vectors both containers -scott on STL
  -advantage of vector is performance
  -can map from one vector space to another
  -tim says strong-typing is good (compiler error to tell you when you made mistake)

Qs:
  -is ::backend a ubiquitous way to do generic programming?
  -IU can only compile one backend at once
    -it would be desirable to compile both at once?
    -or would it be confusing to have both in same file?

Qs:
  -is there cutoff point for SpGEMM to use SpMV?
  -keep vector as 1xN matrix then we can write only SpGEMM

-tim prefers having orientation, because mathematically specifying transpose on vector will cause less error
  -because it provides a hint to whether vector will be multiplied from left or right
  -optimization
